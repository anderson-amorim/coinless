## Coinless Server

Database configuration requires the following environment variables:

```sh
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=database_development
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DIALECT=postgres
```
You can pass them as variables via cmd or put inside a `.env` file on the project's root

To start the server:
```sh
npm install
npm run start

or

yarn
yarn start
```
